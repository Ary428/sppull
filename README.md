## Inspiration and references

This project creation was inspired by [spsave](https://github.com/s-KaiNet/spsave) by [Sergei Sergeev](https://github.com/s-KaiNet) and [gulp-spsync](https://github.com/wictorwilen/gulp-spsync) by [Wictor Wil√©n](https://github.com/wictorwilen) projects.

SPPull depends heavily on [sp-request](https://github.com/s-KaiNet/sp-request) module and use it to send REST queries to SharePoint.
